			Why Replacing a Water Heater Is More Frustrating Than It Should Be

					<h3 class="card-title text-lg font-semibold">Your Water Heater Went Out Suddenly</h3>
					<p class="leading-relaxed">
						It always happens at the worst time — right before guests arrive, or after hours when no one picks up the phone. You need hot water back fast but are forced to call and talk to a dozen salesmen because nobody posts their prices online.

					<h3 class="card-title text-lg font-semibold">You're Not Sure Who to Trust</h3>
					<p class="leading-relaxed">
						Between big box stores, plumbers, and random online ads, it’s hard to know who’s legit. You don’t want to overpay, but you also don’t want to cut corners or deal with a no-show or fly-by-night side-jobber.

					<h3 class="card-title text-lg font-semibold">Quotes Are Confusing or Incomplete</h3>
					<p class="leading-relaxed">
						Some companies won’t give you a price until they show up, others don’t explain the full install process or what's involved. You just want to understand your options, what’s included, what it costs, and when it can be done.

					<h3 class="card-title text-lg font-semibold">You’re Worried About Permits or Code</h3>
					<p class="leading-relaxed">
						You’ve heard horror stories about bad installs, failed inspections, or voided warranties. You want the job done right — by a professional who pulls permits and knows local code.

					<p class="leading-relaxed">
						You're not looking for an upsell to tankless, a water softener package, or to join an 'Elite Membership Club'. You just want a reliable replacement done right the first time — without the pressure.

						You’ve called around and left messages. No call back. Or someone says they’ll come “sometime next week.” You just want someone who will answer, show up, and get the job done at a reasonable price.
