				<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">How do I know if I need a new water heater?</h3>
				<p>
					Most water heaters last 8–12 years. Signs you may need a replacement include inconsistent hot water, strange noises, water around the base, rusty water, or increasing energy bills. If your unit is over 10 years old and showing these signs, it's usually more cost-effective to replace it.

				<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Can you replace my water heater the same day?</h3>
				<p>
					In most cases, yes. If you call early in the day and we have access to the unit size/type you need, we can replace it same-day. We also offer next-day guaranteed appointments.

				<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Can I upgrade to a tankless system?</h3>
				<p>
					Yes, we can install tankless systems. However, not every home is set up for them — they often require electrical or gas upgrades and additional venting. We’ll walk you through pros, cons, and cost so you can decide what fits your needs.
