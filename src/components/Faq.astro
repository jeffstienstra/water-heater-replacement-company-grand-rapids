		question: "How much does a water heater replacement cost?",
		answer: `We don't do 'estimates' because we know our business. Use our 30-second <a href="/instant-quote/?step=1" class="underline font-semibold text-secondary">Exact Quote tool</a> to get an <span class="font-semibold text-primary">actual installed price</span> for your specific home. This includes the unit, labor, permits, and even the haul-away of your old tank. The price you see online is the price you'll see on your invoice after installation. How can we do this? Because we specialize in water heaters and verify your home's setup via photo, video, or in-person visit - whatever is easiest for you - before we schedule the job. No surprises. No gimmicks. Just honest, upfront pricing.`
	},
	{
		question: "Do I really get a price without giving my email?",
		answer: `Yes. You get an exact price without a sales pitch. We believe that if we give you a fair, honest price upfront, you’ll hire us because we’re the easiest company to work with in West Michigan. And dare we say, the funnest? What do you call an extremely unappreciative water heater? ...Tankless.
			<br/><br/>
			But seriously, we're always here if you have questions or need more details. <a aria-label="call 616-315-0999" href="tel:616-315-0999" class="underline text-primary">Call 616-315-0999</a> anytime.`
	},
	{
		question: "What’s the difference between standard, atmospheric, natural draft, power vent, hybrid, and tankless water heaters?",
		type: "typesGrid"
    },
	{
		question: "Why do I need to send a photo or join a video call to verify my price?",
		answer: `The video call isn't for us to 'sell' you—it's for us to guarantee your price. Your <a href="/instant-quote/?step=1" class="underline font-semibold text-secondary">Exact Quote</a> is locked as soon as we verify your home details. We check for items like chimney liners or specific piping and valve needs so we can arrive with the right parts and ensure there are zero price changes once we’re on-site.
			<br />
			<br />
			In the case of in-person checks, we send a technician to your home for a quick 10-minute visit to verify those same details. We do stock several of the most common water heater models in each van so if everything checks out, we can often begin the install right then.
			<br />
			<br />
			Either way, there’s no cost or obligation to move forward. We want you to feel 100% comfortable in your decision.`
	},
	{
		question: "How do I know if I need a new water heater?",
		answer: `Most tank water heaters last around 10–12 years. Signs you may need a replacement include inconsistent hot water, strange noises, water around the base, rusty water, or increasing energy bills. If your unit is over 10 years old and showing these signs, it's usually most cost-effective to replace it.`
	},
	{
		question: "Can you replace my water heater the same day?",
		answer: `In many cases, yes. If you call early in the day and we have access to the unit size/type you need, we can replace it same-day. We also offer next-day appointments.`
	},
	{
		question: "What if I’m not sure what type of water heater I have now?",
		answer: `No problem — just answer a few simple questions (or send a photo), and we’ll identify your current setup. From there, we’ll match you with the most compatible replacement or help you explore high efficiency options if desired.`
	},
	{
		question: "Do I need a permit to replace my water heater in West Michigan?",
		answer: `Yes — whether you are in Grand Rapids or Grandville, Hudsonville or Holland, a plumbing/mechanical permit is required. We handle the permitting process and make sure your install is up to code so you don’t have to worry. An inspector may schedule an inspection after the install to verify everything is safe and code compliant.`
	},
	{
		question: "Do you service both gas and electric water heaters?",
		answer: `Yes. We install and replace both gas and electric water heaters, including tank, tankless, and hybrid models. We’ll confirm your home's fuel type during the quote process to ensure you get the right model. Need to switch from gas to electric or vice versa? We can help with that too, but keep in mind it may require additional work like electrical upgrades or gas line installation, which will require a site visit.`
	},
	{
		question: "Can I upgrade to a tankless system?",
		answer: `Yes, you can absolutely upgrade to a tankless system. Keep in mind not every home is ready for one simply by removing your old water heater — they often require gas line upgrades, rerouting water lines, additional venting, and an outlet installed nearby. We may even need to install a chimney liner if your old water heater shared a chimney with your furnace or boiler.
			<br/><br/>
			While tankless upgrades have more variables, our 30-second <a href="/instant-quote/?step=1" class="text-secondary underline font-bold">Exact Quote tool</a> will give you a clear baseline. We’ll then verify your home's setup via photo, video, or in-person to give you a guaranteed, locked-in quote before we even pull into your driveway.`
	},
	{
		question: "How long does the installation take?",
		answer: `Most standard replacements take about 2–4 hours. If your setup is more complex or requires relocation or venting changes, we’ll let you know up front.`
	},
	{
		question: "Will I be without hot water during the install?",
		answer: `Yes, but only briefly. We’ll disconnect your old unit and install the new one the same day. Hot water is typically restored within a few hours of arrival so you can move on with your day (after a hot shower, of course).`
	},
	{
		question: "Do you dispose of the old water heater?",
		answer: `Yes. Unless you'd like to keep it as a memento, we always remove and dispose of your old water heater and clean up the area after every replacement. You won't even know we were there...well, it might actually be cleaner than it was before.`
	},
	{
		question: "Is the work guaranteed?",
		answer: `Yes — every job includes a minimum <span class="font-bold">2-Year Labor Warranty</span>, a <span class="font-bold">Manufacturer Warranty</span>, and a <span class="font-bold">Satisfaction Guarantee</span>. We install everything to meet code requirements so you won’t have issues during home sales, inspections, or insurance claims.
			<br/><br/>
			Most tanks include a 6-12 year manufacturer warranty. Tankless units include a 10-12 year heat exchanger warranty and 5 year parts warranty. Extended labor and equipment warranties are also available starting at $295.`
