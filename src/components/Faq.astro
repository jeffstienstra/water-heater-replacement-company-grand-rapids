				<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">How do I know if I need a new water heater?</h3>
				<p>
					Most water heaters last 8–12 years. Signs you may need a replacement include inconsistent hot water, strange noises, water around the base, rusty water, or increasing energy bills. If your unit is over 10 years old and showing these signs, it's usually more cost-effective to replace it.

				<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">What’s the difference between standard, power vent, hybrid, and tankless water heaters?</h3>
				<p>
					Standard and power vent heaters store hot water in a tank. Hybrids use a heat pump for high efficiency, and tankless models heat water on demand. We’ll walk you through the pros, cons, and costs of each based on your home setup and usage needs.

			<div class="bg-base-100 border border-base-300 rounded-lg p-5 shadow-sm">
				<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Can you replace my water heater the same day?</h3>
				<p>
					In most cases, yes. If you call early in the day and we have access to the unit size/type you need, we can replace it same-day. We also offer next-day guaranteed appointments.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="bg-base-100 border border-base-300 rounded-lg p-5 shadow-sm">
				<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">How much does a water heater replacement cost?</h3>
				<p>
					Typical replacements range from $1,200 to $2,200 depending on the size (e.g. 40- or 50-gallon), energy source (gas/electric), location of the install, and code requirements. We’ll give you a clear, all-in price before we begin work — no surprises.

			<div class="bg-base-100 border border-base-300 rounded-lg p-5 shadow-sm">
				<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">What if I’m not sure what type of water heater I have now?</h3>
				<p>
					No problem — just answer a few simple questions (or send a photo), and we’ll identify your current setup. From there, we’ll match you with the most compatible replacement or help you explore upgrade options if desired.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Do I need a permit to replace my water heater in Michigan?</h3>
				<p>
					Yes — in most municipalities, a plumbing/mechanical permit is required. We handle the permitting process and make sure your install is up to code so you don’t have to worry.
				</p>

			<div class="bg-base-100 border border-base-300 rounded-lg p-5 shadow-sm">
				<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Do you service both gas and electric water heaters?</h3>
				<p>
					Yes. We install and replace both gas and electric units, including tank, tankless, and hybrid models. We’ll confirm your home's fuel type during the quote process to ensure you get the right model.

			</div>

			<div class="bg-base-100 border border-base-300 rounded-lg p-5 shadow-sm">
				<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Can I upgrade to a tankless system?</h3>
				<p>
					Yes, we can install tankless systems. However, not every home is set up for them — they often require electrical or gas upgrades and additional venting. We’ll walk you through pros, cons, and cost so you can decide what fits your needs.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="bg-base-100 border border-base-300 rounded-lg p-5 shadow-sm">
				<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">How long does the installation take?</h3>
				<p>
					Most standard replacements take about 2–4 hours. If your setup is more complex or requires relocation or venting changes, we’ll let you know up front.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="bg-base-100 border border-base-300 rounded-lg p-5 shadow-sm">
				<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Will I be without hot water during the install?</h3>
				<p>
					Yes, but only briefly. We’ll disconnect your old unit and install the new one the same day in most cases, meaning hot water is typically restored within a few hours of arrival.

			<div class="bg-base-100 border border-base-300 rounded-lg p-5 shadow-sm">
				<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Do you dispose of the old water heater?</h3>

			<div class="bg-base-100 border border-base-300 rounded-lg p-5 shadow-sm">
				<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Is the work guaranteed?</h3>
				<p>
					Yes — every job is guaranteed with a <span class="font-bold">2-Year Labor Warranty</span>, and all tanks come with a manufacturer warranty (6-12 Years). We also install everything to code so you won’t have issues during home sales, inspections, or insurance claims.
