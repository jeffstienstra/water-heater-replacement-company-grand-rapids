		question: "How much does a water heater replacement cost?",
		answer: `Think of it like this:
			“<span class="font-semibold">Cheap now, expensive later</span>” vs. “<span class="font-semibold">Expensive now, cheap later</span>”.
			<br/><br/>
			A basic tank-style water heater is cheaper upfront but will cost you more over time in energy bills and has a shorter lifespan.
			On the other hand, a high-efficiency tankless system costs more to install but saves you money every month and can last over 10 years longer.

	{
		question: "What’s the difference between standard, power vent, hybrid, and tankless water heaters?",
		answer: `A <span class="font-semibold">standard tank water heater</span> uses either electric or gas to heat the water. The gas version vents the exhaust through a chimney or metal flue using a natural draft—no fans, just the fact that heat rises. The electric version has no venting needs but rather heats an electric element inside the tank (like a toaster) and costs more to operate.  These are typically the cheapest to install but the least efficient and cost the most to operate long term.
			<br/><br/>
			A <span class="font-semibold">power vent tank water heater</span> does the same job but uses a fan to push exhaust out of the home through a PVC pipe. It's slightly more efficient but much more flexible for installation location since it vents with PVC. They cost more upfront than natural-draft water heaters and require a standard outlet nearby (to power the exhaust fan), but offer mediocre savings compared to the standard natural-draft gas water heater tanks.
			<br/><br/>
			A<span class="font-semibold"> hybrid (heat pump) water heater</span> uses a refrigerant circuit and compressor to pull heat from the surrounding air and transfer it into the water tank. This is similar to an AC system but instead of an outdoor unit with a fan blowing away the heat, it captures the heat in a water tank. Hybrid water heaters are extremely efficient in the right scenario but households in cold winter climates (like Michigan) or with high hot water needs - think several showers in a row - will regularly cause its backup electric heater to kick in, zapping all the savings away.
			<br/><br/>
			<span class="font-semibold">Tankless or on-demand water heaters</span> don’t store hot water, they heat it right when you use it. You save space, energy, and never “run out” of hot water even with every faucet open, laundry running, and steamy shower flowing. But you’ll pay more upfront and may need to upgrade your gas line and install an outlet nearby to support it. But in the long run, they’re the most efficient and longest-lasting option available. They do require regular maintenance of flushing/descaling the heat exchanger with vinegar or other solutions, but this is fairly simple to do yourself or hire out at a moderate cost. Some claim the money tankless water heaters save is eaten up by people taking longer showers, but we find most people just enjoy the endless hot water and extra floorspace and aren't planning to use the energy savings to fund their retirement.`
	},
	{
		question: "Why do I need a photo or video call to narrow down my price range?",
		answer: `Because we actually want your quote to be right. A brief video call or site assessment assures we know what your home requires for a safe, high-quality installation that is reliable and up to code. For example, does it need a chimney liner, drain pan, new expansion tank, shutoff valves, grounding system, recirulation pump, etc.
			<br/><br/>
			It helps confirm the exact requirements for us and the exact price for you before we start work, so we all know what to expect. No salesman — just a technician checking to make sure everything’s clear for launch.`
	},
	{
		question: "How do I know if I need a new water heater?",
		answer: `Most tank water heaters last around 10–12 years. Signs you may need a replacement include inconsistent hot water, strange noises, water around the base, rusty water, or increasing energy bills. If your unit is over 10 years old and showing these signs, it's usually most cost-effective to replace it.`
	},
	{
		question: "Can you replace my water heater the same day?",
		answer: `In many cases, yes. If you call early in the day and we have access to the unit size/type you need, we can replace it same-day. We also offer next-day appointments.`
	},
	{
		question: "What if I’m not sure what type of water heater I have now?",
		answer: `No problem — just answer a few simple questions (or send a photo), and we’ll identify your current setup. From there, we’ll match you with the most compatible replacement or help you explore high efficiency options if desired.`
	},
	{
		question: "Do I need a permit to replace my water heater in Michigan?",
		answer: `Yes — in most municipalities, a plumbing/mechanical permit is required. We handle the permitting process and make sure your install is up to code so you don’t have to worry. An inspector may schedule an inspection after the install to verify everything is safe and code compliant.`
	},
	{
		question: "Do you service both gas and electric water heaters?",
		answer: `Yes. We install and replace both gas and electric water heaters, including tank, tankless, and hybrid models. We’ll confirm your home's fuel type during the quote process to ensure you get the right model. Need to switch from gas to electric or vice versa? We can help with that too, but keep in mind it may require additional work like electrical upgrades or gas line installation, which will affect the overall cost.`
	},
	{
		question: "Can I upgrade to a tankless system?",
		answer: `Yes, you can absolutely upgrade to a tankless systems. Keep in mind not every home is ready for one simply by removing your old water heater — they often require gas line upgrades, additional venting, and an outlet installed nearby. We may even need to install a chimney liner if your old water heater shared a chimney with your furnace or boiler. Each of these factors affects the installation cost.
			<br/><br/>
			While we try to give as rigid of a price range as possible with our <a href="/instant-quote/?step=1" class="text-primary font-bold">instant quote tool</a>, upgrading from a tank to tankless has the most 'unknowns' to verify. We’ll confirm the exact price on-site before starting work.`
	},
	{
		question: "How long does the installation take?",
		answer: `Most standard replacements take about 2–4 hours. If your setup is more complex or requires relocation or venting changes, we’ll let you know up front.`
	},
	{
		question: "Will I be without hot water during the install?",
		answer: `Yes, but only briefly. We’ll disconnect your old unit and install the new one the same day. Hot water is typically restored within a few hours of arrival so you can move on with your day (after a hot shower, of couse).`
	},
	{
		question: "Do you dispose of the old water heater?",
		answer: `Yes. Unless you'd like to keep it as a memento, we always remove and dispose of your old water heater and clean up the area after every replacement. You won't even know we were there...well, it might actually be cleaner than it was.`
	},
	{
		question: "Is the work guaranteed?",
		answer: `Yes — every job includes a minimum <span class="font-bold">1-Year Labor Warranty</span>, a <span class="font-bold">Manufacturer Warranty</span>, and a <span class="font-bold">Satisfaction Guarantee</span>. We install everything up to Michigan code requirements so you won’t have issues during home sales, inspections, or insurance claims.
			<br/><br/>
			Most tanks include a 6-12 year manufacturer warranty. Tankless units include a 10-12 year heat exchanger warranty and 5 year parts warranty. Extended labor and equipment warranties are also available starting at $295.`
