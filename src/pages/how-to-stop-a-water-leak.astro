			If you're experiencing an active leak from your water heater, follow these steps to safely shut off the water and minimize damage.
		</p>

		<ul class="mb-12 px-6 max-w-2xl mx-auto list-disc list-inside space-y-6 text-left">
			<li>
				<strong>Locate the shutoff valve for the water heater’s cold water supply.</strong> There is typically a lever or knob found on the cold pipe entering your water heater.
				<!-- <img src="/images/shutoff-valve.jpg" alt="Cold water shutoff valve" class="mt-2 rounded-lg shadow-sm"> -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>Rotate the shutoff valve handle clockwise to close it.</strong> This stops new water from entering the water heater.

			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>If your water heater doesn’t have a shutoff valve or it’s not working, locate the main water shutoff valve for your home.</strong> This is usually found near the water meter, in a basement, utility room, crawl space, or near the foundation where the main water line enters the building.
				<!-- <img src="/images/main-shutoff-location.jpg" alt="Main shutoff valve location"> -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>Turn the main shutoff valve clockwise to close it (may require multiple turns).</strong> This will stop water to your entire house until the leak is addressed.

			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>Open a hot water valve on any faucet at the lowest level of your home (e.g., basement sink or tub).</strong> This helps drain excess water and relieves pressure in the water heater and hot water pipes.

			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>Contain the leak.</strong> Use towels, sheets, buckets, mops, a shop-vac (don't forget to replace the dust filter with a sponge/foam filter), or other methods to prevent further water damage in the area of the leak.
