			If you're experiencing an active leak from your water heater or plumbing system, follow these steps to safely shut off the water and minimize damage.
		</p>

		<ul class="mb-12 px-6 max-w-2xl mx-auto list-disc list-inside space-y-6 text-left">
			<li>
				<strong>Locate the water heater’s cold water shutoff valve.</strong> This is typically a lever or knob found on the cold pipe entering the top of the tank (or bottom if it is a tankless wall-mounted unit).
				<!-- <img src="/images/shutoff-valve.jpg" alt="Cold water shutoff valve" class="mt-2 rounded-lg shadow-sm"> -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>Turn the shutoff valve clockwise (right) to close it.</strong> This stops new water from entering the water heater.

			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>If your water heater doesn’t have a shutoff valve or it’s not working, locate the main water shutoff valve for your home.</strong> This is usually found near the water meter, in a basement, utility room, crawl space, or near the foundation where the water line enters.
				<!-- <img src="/images/main-shutoff-location.jpg" alt="Main shutoff valve location"> -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>Turn the main shutoff valve clockwise to close it (may require multiple turns).</strong> This will stop water to your entire house until the leak is addressed.

			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>Open the hot water valve on any faucet at the lowest level of your home (e.g., basement sink or tub).</strong> This helps drain excess water and relieves pressure in the pipes.

			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>Go to the highest level of your home and open the hot water valve on any faucet (e.g., upstairs bathroom, kitchen, etc).</strong> This lets air into the system so the water can drain through the lowest faucet.
				<!-- <img src="/images/open-faucet.jpg" alt="Opening faucet to relieve pressure"> -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>Contain the leak while you wait.</strong> Use towels, sheets, buckets, mops, a shop-vac, or other methods to prevent further water damage in the area of the leak.

			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>Call a licensed plumber for inspection and repair.</strong> Leaks often indicate failed tanks, hoses, valves, joints, pipes, or other pressure issues — have a professional inspect the system before turning water back on.
